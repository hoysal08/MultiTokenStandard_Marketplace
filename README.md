# Multi-standard Token contract for marketplace

This project Uses a ERC1155 contract where in we use particular token ID  to represent fungible tokens, with properties just as standard ERC20.
But this fungible token can later be used to mint NFT's by paying in exchange of the minted NFT.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
```
